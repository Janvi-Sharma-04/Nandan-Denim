                                this myth would seem to be true. Yes, statistically, there are more male leaders
                                represented in most organizations. However, this does not preclude women
                                from taking on leadership roles.

                                Indira Gandhi or certainly Oprah Winfrey and Hilary Clinton? Women have been leading across
                                all sectors of business and government since the beginning of recorded history and earlier.
                                When women have other women leadership role models within the organization, they can better
                                envision their own career paths and success.

                            <p>The real question is: What level of engagement in your work is appropriate and desirable
                                for you at this stage of your life and career? When women can answer that question
                                with certainty and authenticity, they will likely strike the right balance for themselves.

                            <h2 classname="">Myth #4: Women must work harder at learning to lead</h2>
                            <p>Research shows that women naturally possess effective leadership competencies.
                                This means those competencies, such as developing new leaders, demonstrating communication
                                and social skills, utilizing creativity and innovation, problem-solving, demonstrating
                                judgment and team leadership, among others, are naturally available for women leaders.

                            <p>Real talent and hard work in an efficient organization never go to waste.
                                It doesnâ€™t matter who delivers the work until unless it is achieved with utmost precision.
                                So, never underrate yourself.
